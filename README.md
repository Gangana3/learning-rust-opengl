# Learning OpenGL

In chapter 6.6 we build a helper class which will help us load shaders easily.
Instead of refactoring all the main branch I just opened another branch ;).

## Section I - From chapter 6.6 to the end

Continue working with shaders.

### Chapter 7 - Applying textures

In this chapter, instead of using the c library `std_image`
I'll use `image-rs`.

## Exercise 3

TBH, all the exercises in this chapter are too easy so I only completed the
third one.
