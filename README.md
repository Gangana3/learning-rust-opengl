# Learning OpenGL

In chapter 6.6 we build a helper class which will help us load shaders easily.
Instead of refactoring all the main branch I just opened another branch ;).

## Section I - From chapter 6.6 to the end

Continue working with shaders.

### Chapter 6 - Shaders

In this chapter, instead of using the c library `std_image`
I'll use `image-rs`.

### Screenshots

## Exercise 3

TBH, all the exercises in this chapter are too easy so I only completed the
third one.

### Chapter 7 - Applying textures

In this chapter, instead of using the c library `std_image`
I'll use `image-rs`.

## My first texture
Just a random lava texture from the internet...

## Mixing 2 textures 

You can see the lava texture behind the emoji

### Chapter 8 - Transformations

In this chapter, instead of using `glm`, which is a C++ library, 
I'll be using `nalgebra-glm`.

## Transformations

This is the result of applying a transformation matrix that:
* Rotates by 90 degrees
* Scales down to 50%
